<h4> More about myself</h4>
<p> Whenever I am not working or in class, I will be finding ways to be fit. During the week I will get some
    games of basketball in before work. On the weekends I will go on runs early in the morning. This summer,
    I worked full time and then on the weekends I would never want to stay home and relax. I always made an effort to
    travel some place I have never been or done before. That was from jumping off of waterfalls to hiking Precipice Trail
    in Bar Harbor.

    My father, my uncles
    and all of my cousins have all graduated from UMaine. I am majoring in Business Manegment. This is because
    I grew up with my family owning A convienance business that as I grew up, they have almost doubled the amount of
    stores they had when I was born. 5 years ago my mother wanted to venture out into the business field so she
    started up her own organic grocery store business In Brewer Maine.

<p>I stray away from watching television because of all of the advertisements so instead I will often watch youtube
channels. Here is a link to my favorite channel/video.</p>
